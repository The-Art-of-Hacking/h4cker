# Security Vulnerability Scanners

Vulnerability scanners automate security auditing and can play a vital part in your IT security by scanning your network and websites for different security risks. These scanners are also capable of generating a prioritized list of those you should patch, and they also describe the vulnerabilities and provide steps on how to remediate them. It is also possible for some to even automate the patching process.

One of the best lists of popular vulnerability scanners is maintained by OWASP at:
