# Vulnerability Discovery and Analysis

This section focuses on identifying, analyzing, and validating security vulnerabilities across various systems and applications.

## Overview

Vulnerability discovery and analysis involves systematic identification of security weaknesses, validation of findings, and assessment of their potential impact on the target environment.

## Subdirectories

### [Vulnerability Discovery](./Vulnerability_Discovery/)
- Automated vulnerability scanning techniques
- Container, application, and infrastructure assessments
- ICS/OT (Industrial Control Systems/Operational Technology) security testing
- Mobile application security testing

### [Analyzing Results](./Analyzing_Results/)
- Validation of scan results and findings
- False positive and false negative identification
- Exploit selection and customization
- Risk assessment and prioritization

### [Physical Security Concepts](./Physical_Security_Concepts/)
- Physical penetration testing techniques
- Social engineering in physical environments
- Badge cloning and access control bypass
- Lock picking and physical security assessments

## Vulnerability Types

### Network Vulnerabilities
- Unpatched systems and services
- Misconfigurations and default credentials
- Protocol-specific vulnerabilities
- Network segmentation issues

### Application Vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 web application risks
- API security vulnerabilities
- Mobile application weaknesses
- Source code vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Service and daemon vulnerabilities
- Container and orchestration issues
- Cloud configuration problems

## Assessment Methodologies

### Scanning Types
- **Authenticated vs Unauthenticated**: Credentialed vs non-credentialed scans
- **Internal vs External**: Network perspective considerations
- **Static vs Dynamic**: Code analysis vs runtime testing
- **Manual vs Automated**: Human analysis vs tool-based discovery

### Analysis Frameworks
- **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- **CWE** (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)

## Tools and Techniques

### Vulnerability Scanners
- Network vulnerability scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Web application scanners (Nikto, ZAP)
- Container security tools (Grype, Trivy)
- Source code analysis tools (SonarQube, Bandit)

### Validation Methods
- Manual verification of automated findings
- Proof-of-concept development
- Impact assessment and exploitation
- Environmental context analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Test all systems within scope
2. **Regular Updates** - Keep vulnerability databases current
3. **Context Matters** - Consider environmental factors in risk assessment
4. **Validate Findings** - Manually verify critical vulnerabilities
5. **Prioritize Effectively** - Focus on high-impact, exploitable vulnerabilities
