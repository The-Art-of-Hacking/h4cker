# Planning and Scoping a Penetration Testing Assessment

### Planning Phase

#### Initial Client Meeting
- **Objective**: Understand what the client aims to achieve with the penetration test.
- **Key Questions**:
  - What are the key assets you're concerned about?
  - What types of attacks or threats are you most concerned with?
  - Do you have any compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)?

#### Documentation Review
- **Objective**: Review existing documentation to understand the network topology, application architecture, and other relevant details.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Network diagrams
  - Application architecture diagrams
  - Previous vulnerability assessments or pen test reports

#### Legal and Compliance Checks
- **Objective**: Ensure that all legal requirements are met and permissions are granted.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Signed contract
  - Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
  - Permission to test forms

### Scoping Phase

#### Define Scope
- **Objective**: Clearly outline what is in-scope and out-of-scope.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - List of target IP addresses
  - List of target applications
  - User roles for testing authenticated areas

#### Determine Timeframe
- **Objective**: Decide the duration of the test.
- **Key Questions**:
  - When will the test start and end?
  - Are there any blackout periods during which testing should not occur?

#### Resource Allocation
- **Objective**: Decide who will perform the test and what tools will be used.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Names and credentials of the penetration testers
  - List of tools that will be used

#### Success Criteria
- **Objective**: Define what will constitute a successful test.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Expected outcomes
  - Metrics for success (e.g., percentage of high-risk vulnerabilities identified)

#### Finalize Plan
- **Objective**: Consolidate all the above information into a formal test plan.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Penetration Test Plan document
  - Client approval on the plan

By spending ample time on planning and scoping, you're laying a solid foundation for a successful penetration test. This ensures that both the client and the testing team have clear expectations and guidelines, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or scope creep.
