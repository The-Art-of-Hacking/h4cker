# Post-Exploitation and Lateral Movement

This section covers activities that occur after initial system compromise, including maintaining access, expanding foothold, and demonstrating the full impact of security vulnerabilities.

## Overview

Post-exploitation activities demonstrate the true impact of successful attacks by showing how an attacker could maintain persistence, move laterally through networks, and exfiltrate sensitive data. These activities help organizations understand their real-world risk exposure.

## Key Concepts

### Persistence Mechanisms
- **System-Level**: Boot processes, services, drivers
- **User-Level**: Startup folders, scheduled tasks, browser extensions
- **Network-Level**: Backdoor services, reverse shells, C2 beacons
- **Application-Level**: Web shells, application backdoors

### Lateral Movement Techniques
- **Credential-Based**: Pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, credential stuffing
- **Exploit-Based**: Service exploitation, privilege escalation
- **Trust-Based**: Domain trust abuse, certificate abuse
- **Protocol-Based**: SMB, RDP, SSH, WinRM exploitation

### Data Exfiltration Methods
- **Network-Based**: HTTP/HTTPS, DNS tunneling, ICMP
- **Physical-Based**: USB devices, optical media
- **Cloud-Based**: Cloud storage services, email
- **Steganographic**: Hidden data in images, documents

## Common Tools and Techniques

### Persistence Tools
- **Windows**: Scheduled tasks, services, registry, WMI
- **Linux**: Cron jobs, systemd services, SSH keys
- **Cross-Platform**: Web shells, reverse shells, C2 frameworks

### Lateral Movement Tools
- **Credential Harvesting**: Mimikatz, LaZagne, SecretsDump
- **Network Pivoting**: Proxychains, Chisel, SSH tunneling
- **Service Exploitation**: PsExec, WinRM, SMB relay
- **Discovery**: BloodHound, PowerView, ADRecon

### Exfiltration Tools
- **Data Staging**: PowerShell, Python scripts, native utilities
- **Covert Channels**: DNS tunneling, steganography tools
- **Compression/Encryption**: 7zip, GPG, custom tools
- **Transfer Methods**: Cloud APIs, email, FTP, HTTP

## Attack Simulation Frameworks

### Commercial Platforms
- **Cobalt Strike**: Advanced threat emulation
- **Core Impact**: Comprehensive penetration testing
- **Metasploit Pro**: Commercial exploitation framework

### Open Source Tools
- **Caldera**: MITRE's adversary emulation platform
- **Atomic Red Team**: Small, focused attack simulations
- **Infection Monkey**: Automated lateral movement testing
- **PurpleSharp**: Adversary simulation for defense validation

## Operational Security (OPSEC)

### Evasion Techniques
- **Anti-Virus Evasion**: Payload encoding, polymorphism
- **Network Detection Evasion**: Traffic obfuscation, timing
- **Behavioral Evasion**: Living-off-the-land techniques
- **Logging Evasion**: Log tampering, event clearing

### Stealth Considerations
- Minimize system modifications
- Use legitimate tools and processes
- Avoid detection signatures
- Maintain low network profile

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### Authorized Activities Only
- All post-exploitation activities must be within scope
- Maintain proper authorization documentation
- Follow rules of engagement strictly
- Report critical findings immediately

### Data Protection
- Avoid accessing unnecessary sensitive data
- Protect any data encountered during testing
- Use data samples rather than full datasets
- Secure deletion of any collected data

### System Integrity
- Minimize impact on production systems
- Document all changes made to systems
- Restore systems to original state when possible
- Avoid causing service disruptions

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything** - Record all post-exploitation activities and findings
2. **Minimize Impact** - Use least-privilege approaches and avoid unnecessary changes
3. **Validate Access** - Confirm persistence mechanisms work as intended
4. **Demonstrate Impact** - Show realistic attack scenarios and business impact
5. **Clean Up Thoroughly** - Remove all artifacts and restore system states
6. **Secure Communication** - Use encrypted channels for command and control
7. **Time Management** - Balance thoroughness with engagement timeline constraints
