# How to Run Recon-NG in the O'Reilly Labs Environment

You probably already know that O'Reilly has numerous labs. I personally created a few labs that are available in the platform and the links can be found at: https://hackingscenarios.com

In this section, I will show you how to install and run the very popular tool called Recon-NG in the O'Reilly labs:

## Logging in the Lab Environment

1. Login to O'Reilly and access any of the labs in https://hackingscenarios.com. For example:

2. Click START. A terminal window will eventually appear.

3. Type `apt update`.
