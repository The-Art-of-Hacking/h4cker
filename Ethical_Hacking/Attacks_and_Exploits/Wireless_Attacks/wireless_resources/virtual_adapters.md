# Using Kernel Modules to Simulate Wireless Adapters to Practice Pen Testing

You can use mac80211_hwsim is a software simulator of 802.11 radio(s) for mac80211 in Kali Linux and other penetration testing distributions like Parrot.

[mac80211_hwsim](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/mac80211_hwsim) kernel module has a parameter 'radios' that can be used to select how many radios are simulated (default 2). This allows configuration of both very simply setups (e.g., just a single access point and a station) or large scale tests (multiple access points with hundreds of stations).

The following site provides a description:

## Starting the Kernel Module in Kali

In my Kali Linux box, I have only one active interface (eth0). 

```
root@kali:~# ip -brie a
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             172.16.217.170/24 fe80::20c:29ff:fe3c:82b0/64
```

I am starting the simulator kernel module with the `modprobe mac80211_hwsim` command:

```
root@kali:~# modprobe mac80211_hwsim radios 8
```

After starting the module, the wireless interfaces are shown:

```
root@kali:~# ip -brie a
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             172.16.217.170/24 fe80::20c:29ff:fe3c:82b0/64
wlan0            DOWN
wlan1            DOWN
hwsim0           DOWN
```

You can then install `hostapd` to create a wireless access point and then use aircrack-ng to perform wireless assessments.


## Install and Configure hostapd

You can then install `hostapd`, as shown below:

```
root@kali:~# sudo apt install hostapd

Running kernel seems to be up-to-date.

No services need to be restarted.

No containers need to be restarted.

**Note:** You can obtain the example of my `hostapd.conf` file [here](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/blob/master/wireless_resources/hostapd.conf).

In my case, I ran into the following problem:

```
root@kali:# hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Configuration file: /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
nl80211: Could not configure driver mode
nl80211: deinit ifname=wlan0 disabled_11b_rates=0
nl80211 driver initialization failed.
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->DISABLED
wlan0: AP-DISABLED
hostapd_free_hapd_data: Interface wlan0 wasn't started
```
I fixed it as follows:

```
root@kali:# sudo nmcli radio wifi off
root@kali:# sudo rfkill unblock wlan
root@kali:# sudo ifconfig wlan0 10.15.0.1/24 up
root@kali:# hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Configuration file: /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 26:6f:2b:e1:48:d1 and ssid "corp-net"
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED
```

## Running aircrack-ng

If you are not familiar with aircrack-ng, you can watch the video course at: https://h4cker.org/wireless

Let's start `airmon-ng` and then launch `airodump-ng` just to test our configuration:

```
root@kali:~# airmon-ng start wlan1

Found 3 processes that could cause trouble.
If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after
a short period of time, you may want to run 'airmon-ng check kill'

  PID Name
  544 NetworkManager
  576 dhclient
  723 wpa_supplicant

PHY	Interface	Driver		Chipset

phy0	wlan0		mac80211_hwsim	Software simulator of 802.11 radio(s) for mac80211

		(mac80211 monitor mode vif enabled for [phy1]wlan1 on [phy1]wlan1mon)
		(mac80211 station mode vif disabled for [phy1]wlan1)

root@kali:~#
```

Now, let's run airodump-ng:

```
root@kali:~# airodump-ng wlan1mon
```

You should see the corp-net SSID that is configured in the hostapd.conf file.

```

## Installing DHCP server

Dnsmasq is going to act as our DNS and DHCP server, it can be installed with apt-get install dnsmasq. This is another super simple service with an easy to understand config file. Below is what I used, it defines a DHCP range, sets the router and DNS servers as 10.0.0.1 (options 3 and 6) and sets our upstream DNS server to one of OpenDNS's public DNS servers (server=208.67.222.222).

```
interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.100,8h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=208.67.222.222
log-queries
log-dhcp
```
