# Attacks and Exploits

This section covers the active exploitation phase of penetration testing, including various attack vectors and exploitation techniques across different technologies and platforms.

## Overview

The attacks and exploits phase involves the actual exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their impact and potential for compromise. This phase requires careful planning, precise execution, and thorough documentation.

## Ethical Considerations

### Rules of Engagement
- Stay within defined scope boundaries
- Avoid causing system damage or downtime
- Protect sensitive data discovered during testing
- Follow escalation procedures for critical findings

### Legal Requirements
- Maintain proper authorization documentation
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations
- Report findings through approved channels
- Preserve evidence according to legal standards

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Thoroughly** - Understand targets and potential impacts before attacking
2. **Start Simple** - Begin with low-risk attacks before escalating
3. **Document Everything** - Record all attack attempts and results
4. **Minimize Impact** - Avoid causing unnecessary damage or disruption
5. **Validate Success** - Confirm successful exploitation and document evidence
6. **Clean Up** - Remove artifacts and restore systems when possible
