- [A Simple Hunting Maturity Model](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com.au/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html) - The Hunting Maturity Model describes five levels of organizational hunting capability, ranging from HMM0 (the least capability) to HMM4 (the most).
- [The Pyramic of Pain](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) - The relationship between the types of indicators you might use to detect an adversary's activities and how much pain it will cause them when you are able to deny those indicators to them.
- [A Framework for Cyber Threat Hunting](http://sqrrl.com/media/Framework-for-Threat-Hunting-Whitepaper.pdf)
- [The PARIS Model](http://threathunter.guru/blog/the-paris-model/) - A model for threat hunting.
- [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/aerospace-defense/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) - It is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.
- [The DML Model](http://ryanstillions.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/the-dml-model_21.html) - The Detection Maturity Level (DML) model is a capability maturity model for referencing ones maturity in detecting cyber attacks.
