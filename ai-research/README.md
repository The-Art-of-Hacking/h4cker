# AI Security Research Resources

## Langchain Resources
- [Tools, Learning, Notebooks, Bots, Agent examples, etc.](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/ai-research/LangChain/README.md)

## LLM Frameworks
- [Popular LLM Frameworks](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/ai-research/LLM-frameworks)

## Collection of Jupyter Notebooks
This is (by far) the best collection of colab notebooks I have found. A bit overwhelming and I wish I had time to go through most of them… Tons of links to papers, videos, etc.: https://github.com/amrzv/awesome-colab-notebooks
